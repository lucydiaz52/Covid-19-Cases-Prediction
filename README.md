# Covid-19-Cases-Prediction
# Covid-19 Cases Prediction with Python

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days using Python and machine learning techniques. Predictive models like this one are crucial for understanding the likely spread and impact of infectious diseases, enabling governments and policymakers to make informed decisions and assess the effectiveness of implemented policies.

## Project Description
The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Load the Datasets**: 
   - Download the global confirmed cases and deaths datasets.
   - Place these datasets in your working directory.
   - Load them into your Python script using `pandas`.

2. **Prepare the Data**: 
   - Clean and organize the data by combining the confirmed cases and deaths datasets.
   - Summarize the cases by country, removing inconsistencies in country names.
   - Prepare the data for further analysis.

3. **Visualize the Data**:
   - Create a geographical visualization (choropleth map) to display the worldwide spread of Covid-19.
   - Visualize daily Covid-19 cases and deaths globally using line plots to understand trends and patterns.

4. **Predict Future Cases**:
   - Utilize the Facebook Prophet model, a powerful time series forecasting tool, to predict Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days.
   - Visualize the forecasted results, including confidence intervals.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the RÂ² score.

## Libraries and Tools
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `fbprophet`
- `scikit-learn`

## Data Sources
The datasets used in this project are:
- **Global Confirmed Cases Dataset**
- **Global Deaths Dataset**
  
These datasets can be found and downloaded from public data repositories, such as those hosted on GitHub or other Covid-19 data sources.

## Steps to Run the Project
1. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly fbprophet scikit-learn
   ```
2. **Load the datasets**:
Download the datasets and place them in your working directory. Then, load them into your Python script using pandas.

3. **Prepare the data**:
Clean and organize the data by combining the datasets, summarizing the cases by country, and preparing it for analysis.

4. **Visualize the data**:
Create visualizations to understand the spread and daily trends of Covid-19 cases and deaths.

5. **Predict future cases**:
Use the Facebook Prophet model to forecast Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days and visualize the predicted results.

6. **Example Visualizations**
Geographical Spread of Covid-19: A choropleth map showing the distribution of Covid-19 cases across different countries.
Daily Covid-19 Cases and Deaths: Line plots illustrating the trends in daily reported cases and deaths globally.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive approach to predicting the spread of Covid-19 using historical data and machine learning. The results can be used to support public health decisions and policy-making efforts.
